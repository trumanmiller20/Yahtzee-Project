    <a href="game.html">PLAY GAME</a>
    <p>The game consists of thirteen rounds. At the end of the thirteenth round the game ends. (All the categories on the score card will be completely filled in at that point.)<br><br>
    At the start of a round, the player takes all 5 dice and rolls them. They can then roll some or all of the dice up to two more times, reserving any dice they’d like to keep and rerolling the rest.<br><br>The dice can be scored after any of the rolls, but scoring the dice ends the player’s turn. Setting dice aside after one roll does not prevent one or more of them from being rolled again on any subsequent roll if the player so chooses.<br><br>
    The player's goal is to try and score as high as they can in one of the thirteen categories.
    To score the dice, the player selects an available category button (corresponding to that portion of the score card).<br><br>
    If the player selects a category that they do not have the correspoding dice combination for, a score of zero will be applied and that section can no longer be scored that game.<br><br>
    After scoring, the round ends and play proceeds.
    The categories on the score card are divided into two sections.<br><br>The categories in the Upper Section are:<br><br><br>ONES: Receive 1 point for each 1 rolled.<br><br>TWOS: Receive 2 points for each 2 rolled.<br><br>THREES: Receive 3 points for each 3 rolled<br><br>FOURS: Receive 4 points for each 4 rolled<br><br>FIVES: Receive 5 points for each 5 rolled<br><br>SIXES: Receive 6 points for each 6 rolled<br><br>Ultimately the player will want to try and score a grand total of 63 or more points in the Upper Section by the end of the game. If done, they receive a 35 point bonus to their game total.<br><br>
    The categories in the Lower Section are:<br><br>THREE OF A KIND: Three dice of the same number. Add up all the spots on all the dice. (For example, rolling 2-2-2-3-5 would score a total of 14 points).<br><br>
    FOUR OF A KIND: Four dice of the same number. Add up all the spots on all the dice.<br><br>
    FULL HOUSE: Three dice showing the same number, and two dice showing another number. Player scores 25 points.<br><br>
    SMALL STRAIGHT: Any four consecutive numbers (for example, 3-4-5-6). Player scores 30 points.<br><br>
    LARGE STRAIGHT: Any five consecutive numbers (for example, 1-2-3-4-5). Player scores 40 points.<br><br>
    YAHTZEE: All 5 dice showing the same number. Player scores 50 points. Yahtzee is the only scoring method that can be applied more than once, but only if the player has NOT elected to apply a score of 0 to the section in a previous round.<br><br>
    CHANCE: Any combination of dice. Add up all the spots on all the dice<br><br>
    It’s possible that a player will end up with a combination of dice that could be used in more than one category. For example, a roll of 3-3-3-4-4 could be scored as threes or fours in the Upper Section, or as a Full House or a Three-Of-A-Kind, or Chance in the Lower Section. The player has the option of scoring the dice in any one of those categories as long as they have not been used in a previous round.</p>
